**Knockout** is a Spigot plugin that introduces a unique *knockout* mechanic as an alternative to direct player death. Instead of dying instantly, players can be incapacitated and revived or carried to safety. This opens the door for more strategic, team-oriented gameplay and immersive PvP or PvE scenarios.

## üî• Features

- Players are knocked out instead of dying.
- Revive knocked-out players by sneaking near them.
- Carry downed players to safe locations.
- Fully configurable system (knockout time, effects, behavior).
- Permissions and admin commands included.
- PlaceholderAPI support.
- Custom messages and titles.
- Compatible with Minecraft versions **1.19.x to 1.21.x**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Download the latest `.jar` release from [spigotmc.org](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/knockout.119934/).
2. Place it into your server's `plugins/` directory.
3. Restart or reload the server.
4. Modify `config.yml` if needed.
